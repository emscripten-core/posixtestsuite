 This program tests pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np() function.

 Using PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NONRECURSIVE_NP to initialize rwlock
 which prefers to writer. Such rwlock can make sure writer thread has 
 chance to run in multi-reader scenario.

 Steps:
 1. Main thread initializes rwlock with PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NONRECURSIVE_NP.
 2. Main thread creates reader thread 1.
 3. Main thread creates writer thread.
 4. Main thread creates reader thread 2.
 5. Reader thread 1 got rwlock and then waiting for reader thread 2 to
    tell him go ahead.
 6. Writer thread requires rwlock and then block on it.
 7. Reader thread 2 trys to require rwlock and it fails which is what we expect.
    Reader thread 2 tells reader thread 1 to go ahead. Reader thread 2 requires
	rwlock and block on it.
 8. Reader thread 1 go ahead and unlocks rwlock.
 9. Writer thread should get rwlock. Writer thread unlocks rwlock.
 10. Reader thread 2 gets rwlock.
