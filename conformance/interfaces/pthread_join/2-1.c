 * Test that pthread_join()

 * On return from a successful pthread_join() call with a non-NULL 'value_ptr'
 * argument, the avlue passed to pthread_exit() by the terminating thread shall
 * be made available in the location referenced by 'value_ptr'.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a new thread.  Have it return a return code on pthread_exit();
 * 2.  Call pthread_join() in main(), and pass to it 'value_ptr'.
 * 3.  Check to see of the value_ptr and the value returned by pthread_exit() are the same;
