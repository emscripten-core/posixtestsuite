 * Test that pthread_join()
 *  
 * When pthread_join() returns successfully, the target thread has been
 * terminated.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a new thread.
 * 2.  Send a cancel request to it from main, then use pthread_join to wait for it to end.
 * 3.  The thread will sleep for 3 seconds, then call test_cancel() to cancel execution.
 * 4.  When this happens, the cleanup handler should be called.  
 * 5.  Main will test that when pthread_join allows main to continue with the process that
 *     the thread has ended execution.  If the cleanup_handler was not called, then the
 *     test fails.
