 * Test that pthread_join()
 *  
 * pthread_join() SHALL fail if:
 *
 * -[ESRCH] No thread could be found corresponding to that thread ID  
 *
 * pthread_join() MAY fail if:

 * -[EINVAL] The implementation has detected that the value specified by
 *  'thread' does not refer to a joinable thread.
 * -[EDEADLK] A deadlock was detected or the value of 'thread' specifies the 
 *  calling thread.
  
 * It shall not return an error code of [EINTR]
 *
 * Testing ESRCH
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a new thread.
 * 2.  Call pthread_join() in main. This means that the thread should have ended execution.
 * 3.  Call pthread_join() again, it should give the error code ESRCH.
